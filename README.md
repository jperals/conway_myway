RGB automaton
=============

Colourful variation of Conway's Game Of Life in which parameters can be manipulated live.

Press "q" and "a" to increase and decrease, respectively, the minimum number of living neighbour cells that each cell needs to keep living (by default 2), and "w" and "s" to manipulate the maximum number (by default 3).

Pressing a number between 0 and 9 will give the exact number of needed living neighbouring cells that a dead cell needs to come back to life (by default 3).

Each cell has a binary state (live or dead) for each colour component (red, green and blue).
